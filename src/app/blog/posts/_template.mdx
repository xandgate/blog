## Introduction

Start with a hook—a problem you faced, a surprising discovery, or a bold claim. Your reader should know within 2 sentences whether this post is for them.

## The Problem / Context

Set up the situation. What were you trying to accomplish? What was the conventional approach? Why wasn't it working?

## The Insight / Solution

This is your main contribution. What did you learn or build? Be specific—include code snippets, screenshots, or concrete examples.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
      {
        code: `// Example code block
const example = "Your code here";`,
        language: "typescript",
        label: "example.ts"
      }
    ]}
/>

## Results / What Changed

Quantify the impact where possible. "50% faster" beats "much faster." Share before/after comparisons.

## Lessons Learned

What would you do differently? What surprised you? This is where your experience shows.

## What's Next

Optional: tease future posts or invite readers to share their experiences.
