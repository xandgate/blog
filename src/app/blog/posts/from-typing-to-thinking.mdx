## The Moment Everything Changed

I was debugging a gnarly race condition at 11pm—the kind of problem I'd solved a hundred times before. Different codebase, same pattern. As I methodically traced through the execution flow, a thought hit me: I've spent 15 years learning to recognize these patterns. Why am I still typing out the solutions by hand?

That night, I started experimenting with AI coding assistants in earnest. Three months later, my entire engineering practice had transformed.

## What I Used to Do vs. What I Do Now

**Before:** I'd spend hours implementing solutions I could already visualize. The code was in my head—I just needed to type it out, handle edge cases, and write tests.

**Now:** I describe the solution, review what the AI generates, catch the edge cases it misses, and move on to the next problem. The bottleneck shifted from my typing speed to my thinking speed.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: for routine implementation work, AI is faster and often more thorough than I am. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't forget to handle null checks. It writes tests without complaining.

But here's what AI can't do: it can't smell a bad architecture decision from three files away. It can't tell you that the "quick fix" someone's proposing will haunt the team for years. It can't sit in a meeting and realize that the actual problem is completely different from the stated requirements.

## The Skills That Matter More Now

After a few months of AI-augmented development, I've identified what actually differentiates senior engineers in this new world:

**1. Pattern recognition at the system level.** Knowing *what* to build is more valuable than knowing *how* to build it. AI can implement a caching layer, but it can't tell you whether you need one.

**2. Debugging intuition.** When AI-generated code fails, you need to understand it well enough to fix it. This requires deep knowledge of how systems actually work—the kind that takes years to develop.

**3. Technical judgment.** Every day I make dozens of small decisions: this library vs. that one, this pattern vs. that approach, build vs. buy. AI can list the options, but picking the right one requires context and experience.

**4. Code review at speed.** Reading and evaluating code quickly is now more valuable than writing it. I spend more time reviewing AI output than I ever spent reviewing junior engineer PRs.

## What I'm Still Figuring Out

I don't have this all figured out. Some open questions I'm exploring:

- How do you maintain deep technical skills when you're not writing as much code by hand?
- What's the right balance between trusting AI output and verifying everything?
- How do we onboard junior engineers when the "grunt work" that taught us fundamentals is now automated?

I'll be writing more about these as I learn. For now, I'm focused on one thing: using AI to amplify what I'm already good at, rather than using it as a crutch for what I'm not.

## The Bottom Line

AI didn't make my 15 years of experience obsolete—it made those years more valuable. The judgment, intuition, and pattern recognition I've built up are now force multiplied by tools that can implement at machine speed.

The engineers who thrive in this new world won't be the ones who can type the fastest. They'll be the ones who can think the clearest.
