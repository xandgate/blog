## The Conversation That Keeps Happening

I was in a project kickoff last month. Stakeholders around the table. Someone asks about the timeline.

"We've got 16 weeks to launch. We'll do accessibility testing in week 15."

I've heard this exact sentence at least a dozen times in my career. It's not a plan. It's a prayer.

## Why Accessibility Gets Deprioritized

It's not malice. It's usually one of these:

**"We'll fix it later."** Accessibility debt compounds faster than technical debt. A non-compliant component used 200 times means 200 instances to fix.

**"Our users don't have disabilities."** Government websites serve everyone. You don't get to choose your audience.

**"The tool handles it."** No CMS makes your content accessible automatically. The tool provides capabilities. Humans still have to use them correctly.

**"We passed automated testing."** Automated tools catch maybe 30% of accessibility issues. The rest requires manual testing and human judgment.

## What Actually Works

After building platforms for federal and state agencies, here's what I've seen succeed:

### 1. Accessible Component Libraries

Don't let developers build buttons from scratch. Give them accessible buttons that work out of the box.

Every component should ship with:
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader testing documentation

Build once, use everywhere. Accessibility becomes the path of least resistance.

### 2. Content Author Training

The prettiest, most accessible template becomes non-compliant the moment someone:
- Uploads an image without alt text
- Creates a table without headers
- Uses color alone to convey information
- Writes a link that says "click here"

Train content authors. Then train them again. Then build guardrails.

### 3. Continuous Testing, Not Launch Testing

Add accessibility checks to your CI/CD pipeline. Catch issues before they merge.

Use a mix of:
- Automated scanning (axe-core, WAVE)
- Manual keyboard testing
- Screen reader testing (actual users, not just developers)

When a build fails accessibility, it fails. Period.

### 4. Real User Testing

I've watched sighted developers "test" with screen readers for five minutes and declare victory.

Budget for testing with actual users who rely on assistive technology. The insights are humbling and invaluable.

### 5. Executive Buy-In

Accessibility needs teeth. Someone with authority has to be willing to delay launches for compliance issues.

If accessibility can always be overridden by "business priorities," it will be.

## The Business Case (If You Need One)

- Section 508 is law. Non-compliance is legal risk.
- Accessible sites work better for everyone, including mobile users, people in bright sunlight, and users with temporary injuries.
- Accessible code is usually cleaner code. Semantic HTML benefits SEO, maintainability, and performance.
- Retrofitting accessibility is 10x more expensive than building it in.

But honestly, the best reason is simpler: government websites exist to serve citizens. All of them.

## The Standard I Hold

When I build a government platform, the goal isn't "pass an audit." The goal is: a person using a screen reader can accomplish every task a sighted user can, with equivalent effort.

That's a higher bar. It's the right bar.
