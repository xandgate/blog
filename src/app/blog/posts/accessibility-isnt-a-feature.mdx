## The Conversation That Keeps Happening

I was in a project kickoff last month. Stakeholders around the table. Someone asks about the timeline.

"We've got 16 weeks to launch. We'll do accessibility testing in week 15."

I've heard this exact sentence, or a version of it, at least a dozen times across federal and state projects. It is not a plan. It is a prayer. And by week 15, when the accessibility audit comes back with eighty-seven findings, the prayer shifts to: "We'll fix the critical ones before launch and document a remediation plan for the rest."

The remediation plan rarely gets executed. The critical findings get debated — what counts as critical, exactly? — and launch happens anyway.

I've watched this happen at agencies where the procurement contract explicitly required Section 508 compliance. The contract wasn't wrong; the process was wrong. Compliance was treated as an audit gate rather than a construction standard, which meant it arrived too late to be anything except damage control.

## What Actually Works

After building platforms for federal agencies, state governments, and large healthcare organizations, here's what I've seen succeed — and it's not a checklist.

**Accessible component libraries.** Don't let developers build buttons from scratch. Build accessible buttons, modals, form fields, and data tables that work correctly by default, and give those to every developer on the project. Each component should ship with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader testing documentation. When accessibility is the path of least resistance, it gets used. When it requires extra effort per component, it gets skipped.

On an Arizona state government project, we built a shared component library before writing a single feature. Every form field handled accessible error states. Every modal trapped focus correctly. Every table had proper header associations. Developers who had never thought about accessibility before were building compliant interfaces because that's what the tools gave them. The final Section 508 audit found eleven issues across a platform with hundreds of components. Most of them were content issues, not structural ones.

**Content author training — and then guardrails.** The most architecturally accessible platform becomes non-compliant within months if content authors aren't trained. Someone uploads an image without alt text. A table gets published without headers. A link says "click here." These are not edge cases; they are routine.

Training helps but doesn't hold. Build guardrails in the CMS: require alt text before an image can be saved, flag heading level skips, prevent color-only information conventions. The guardrail doesn't replace judgment, but it does stop the most common failure modes from becoming invisible.

**Accessibility in the CI/CD pipeline.** Automated tools catch around 30% of accessibility issues, which means they're insufficient on their own — but that 30% is reliably caught and reliably fails builds if you configure them that way. Add axe-core or a similar scanner to your pipeline. When a build fails accessibility, it fails. No exceptions for "we'll fix it later," because later is what produced the week-15 audit crisis.

The remaining 70% requires manual keyboard testing and screen reader testing with real users. Not developers with screen readers turned on for the first time. Actual users who rely on assistive technology and navigate the entire task flow, not just the happy path.

**Executive buy-in with teeth.** Every accessibility program I've seen fail had an executive somewhere who was willing to override it for a deadline. If "business priorities" can always outweigh compliance, compliance will always lose. Someone with authority has to be willing to delay a launch for accessibility findings. Once that boundary holds once, teams stop treating it as negotiable.

## The Standard I Hold

The legal standard — Section 508 compliance — is a floor, not a ceiling. The audit will tell you whether you pass. It won't tell you whether the platform actually works for someone who depends on a screen reader to use the internet.

The standard I hold on every government project: a person using a screen reader can accomplish every task a sighted user can, with equivalent effort.

Not "can technically complete the task." Not "can complete it with workarounds." Equivalent effort. If it takes a sighted user thirty seconds to submit a benefits application and it takes a screen reader user eight minutes because the form flow is confusing, the form is not accessible, regardless of what the audit says.

That's the right bar. Build toward it from the first sprint, not the fifteenth.

*The week-15 accessibility audit is a symptom of a procurement and process failure, not a technical one. What would it take for your organization to treat accessibility the way you treat security — as something that fails a build, not something that gets a remediation plan?*
