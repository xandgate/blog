## The Question

I was mentoring a junior engineer last week. They were struggling with a bug, so I suggested they ask Cursor for help. Cursor solved it in 30 seconds.

The junior engineer was relieved. I was worried.

Not because AI solved the problem—that's fine. But because the junior engineer didn't learn anything. They got the answer without understanding the process. And understanding the process is how you become a senior engineer.

This is the question I've been wrestling with: if AI can write code better than junior engineers, how do we train the next generation?

## The Old Model (And Why It Worked)

The traditional path to senior engineer was:

1. **Write lots of code** — You learn by doing, making mistakes, and fixing them
2. **Review senior code** — You see patterns, best practices, and architectural decisions
3. **Get code reviewed** — You learn from feedback and understand why certain approaches are better
4. **Debug production issues** — You develop intuition for how systems actually work
5. **Make mistakes** — You learn what not to do, often the hard way

This worked because the bottleneck was implementation. Junior engineers spent years implementing features, and through that process, they learned to think like senior engineers.

But if AI handles implementation, what's left for junior engineers to do?

## The New Challenge

Here's what I'm seeing:

**Junior engineers are using AI to skip the learning curve.** They're generating code they don't understand, getting it reviewed, and shipping it. They're productive immediately, but they're not learning.

**Senior engineers are struggling to mentor.** The traditional mentoring model—pair programming, code review, explaining decisions—doesn't work when the code is AI-generated. How do you explain why you made a decision when you didn't make it?

**The skill gap is widening.** Junior engineers who rely on AI aren't developing the foundational skills they need. When they encounter a problem AI can't solve, they're stuck.

## What I Think Will Happen

I don't have all the answers, but here's what I'm seeing and what I think will happen:

### 1. The Learning Path Will Change

Junior engineers will need to learn differently. Instead of writing code, they'll need to:

- **Review AI output** — Learn to spot problems, understand patterns, evaluate quality
- **Debug AI code** — When AI-generated code fails, figure out why
- **Make architectural decisions** — Learn to think at a higher level, earlier
- **Understand systems** — Learn how systems work, not just how to implement features

The fundamentals are the same, but the path is different.

### 2. Mentoring Will Focus on Judgment, Not Implementation

Instead of "here's how to write this function," mentoring will be "here's how to evaluate whether this function is correct."

Instead of "here's the pattern to use," it'll be "here's how to choose between patterns."

The focus shifts from implementation to judgment.

### 3. The Bar for "Junior" Will Rise

If AI handles implementation, what's left for junior engineers? I think they'll need to:

- Understand systems architecture
- Make design decisions
- Review and evaluate code
- Debug complex issues

These are skills that used to take years to develop. Now, junior engineers will need them from day one.

### 4. Some Junior Engineers Will Struggle

Not everyone will adapt. Engineers who relied on "write code, get feedback, improve" will struggle when the feedback loop changes.

But engineers who are curious, who ask "why," who want to understand systems—they'll thrive.

## What I'm Doing Differently

I'm experimenting with new mentoring approaches:

**AI-assisted learning:** Instead of having junior engineers write code, I have them review AI-generated code. They learn to spot issues, understand patterns, and evaluate quality.

**Architecture discussions:** I spend more time discussing why we made decisions, not just what we built. Junior engineers need to understand the reasoning, not just the implementation.

**Debugging sessions:** When AI-generated code fails, I walk through the debugging process. This is where the real learning happens.

**Code review focus:** I review AI-generated code with junior engineers, explaining what I'm looking for and why. They learn to review code, which is now more valuable than writing it.

## The Truth

I don't know if this will work. The traditional model worked for decades. This new model is untested.

But I'm optimistic. Because the fundamentals haven't changed: curious engineers who want to understand systems will always find a way to learn. The path might be different, but the destination is the same.

## The Bottom Line

AI is changing how we write code, but it's also changing how we learn to write code. The traditional path—write lots of code, make mistakes, learn from them—doesn't work when AI handles the writing.

We need new models for training junior engineers. We need to focus on judgment, not implementation. We need to teach them to think like senior engineers, not just write code like them.

And we need to figure this out fast. Because the next generation of engineers is learning now, and we're still figuring out how to teach them.
