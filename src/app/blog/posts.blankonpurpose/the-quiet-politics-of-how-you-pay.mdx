I paid for coffee with cash last week. The person behind the counter looked mildly surprised, then pleased — the transaction was done before I'd even put my wallet away. No loading spinner. No payment processing. No record of it anywhere except, I suppose, in both of our memories.

I've been thinking about that exchange a lot more than a coffee purchase probably warrants.

## The Arrangement Nobody Reads

Every time you pay for something, you're agreeing to terms. Not the terms-of-service kind — nobody reads those. The structural kind. Who can see this transaction? Who can reverse it? Who can stop it from happening at all? What happens if the company processing it decides they don't want to handle your kind of business anymore?

Most of the time, these questions don't matter. Coffee is coffee. But sometimes they do, and then you realize you'd never actually thought about them.

The interesting thing is that cash, cards, and crypto give radically different answers to all of these questions. And most people pick their payment method based entirely on which app is on their phone, never noticing that they've quietly opted into one arrangement of power over another.

## What Cash Can Do That Nothing Else Can

Cash is underrated. Not because it's convenient — it's not — but because of what it allows.

It works without infrastructure. No signal, no account, no approval from anyone. You hand it over, they take it. That's the whole protocol. There's no company in the middle that can decide your account is suspicious, your industry is too risky, or your political views make you a liability.

This sounds abstract until it isn't. In 2022, Canadian banks froze the accounts of people who donated to the trucker convoy. You can have any opinion you want about the convoy — that's not the point. The point is that the mechanism for freezing accounts worked, and it worked quietly and quickly, and the people whose accounts were frozen had no recourse while the freeze was in place. Cash donors had no such problem.

Cash is also the money of the unbanked. About 1.4 billion adults globally have no bank account. For them, digital payments aren't a preference — they're inaccessible. Cash isn't a legacy technology for these people. It's the only technology.

The downsides are obvious: you can lose it, it's heavy in large amounts, it doesn't work for online purchases, and it stops at borders. It has no memory, which is its strength and its limitation simultaneously.

## What Cards and Digital Payments Extracted in Exchange for Convenience

The deal with digital payments is simple: you give up privacy and control, you get convenience and reach.

Your credit card company knows everywhere you've been. Your bank can freeze your account. PayPal has famously closed the accounts of gun shops, sex workers, adult content platforms, CBD vendors, and various other legal businesses that someone decided were too controversial to service. Stripe has done the same. These companies aren't governments, but they've assumed a governmental kind of power over commerce without any of the corresponding accountability.

The convenience is real, though. Global reach, consumer protection, chargebacks, fraud reversals — these matter. And for most transactions, none of the control questions come up.

But I think people underestimate how much of what feels like financial freedom is actually conditional on continued goodwill from intermediaries. Your money is in an account you access by permission. That permission can be revoked faster than any legal process can respond.

## What Crypto Gets Right (And What It Gets Wrong)

Crypto is genuinely interesting on the freedom question, and genuinely weird on several others.

The core property that matters: censorship resistance. A Bitcoin transaction, once confirmed, cannot be reversed. No company can freeze a Bitcoin wallet they don't control. No government can instruct Satoshi Nakamoto to block a payment. If you hold your own keys — actually hold them, not on an exchange — you have money that no intermediary can touch.

This is significant. Not just for protesters or dissidents (though it matters for them), but for anyone who's ever had a payment processor suddenly decide their business is unacceptable. Crypto is the first time in history that ordinary people have had access to bearer assets with global reach. Cash had the first part; gold had both but not the global reach. Crypto threads the needle in a way that's genuinely new.

The programmability is interesting too. Smart contracts mean money can have logic baked in — release payment when the conditions are met, split revenue automatically, hold funds in escrow without trusting a third party. This is capability that neither cash nor cards have.

But the tradeoffs are real. The blockchain is *public*. More public than most people realize. Cash is private by default; crypto transactions are pseudonymous at best, and the chain of custody is permanently recorded and permanently analyzable. Privacy coins exist, but they're a minority use case.

The volatility problem is also not solved. A payment method that's worth 20% less by the time the merchant processes it is a problem. Stablecoins address this but introduce new trust assumptions.

And the technical barrier remains genuinely high. "Hold your own keys" is the right answer to the control problem, and it's also something most people will never do correctly.

## So Which One Is Capable of More?

It depends entirely on what you're trying to do.

Cash is capable of more if you need to transact without any record, without any account, or with someone who can't access digital infrastructure. It's also the only option where the counterparty has to be physically present, which is sometimes a feature and often a constraint.

Crypto is capable of more if you need censorship resistance, global reach without intermediaries, programmable money, or a bearer asset that crosses borders at the speed of the internet.

Cards and digital payments are capable of more if you need consumer protection, broad acceptance, and you're comfortable with the implicit bargain about surveillance and control.

The thing I keep coming back to: for most people in stable countries with reliable banking, the control questions are invisible. The system works, and the hypothetical that it might not work for you feels paranoid. But the 1.4 billion unbanked, and the businesses that PayPal quietly dropped, and the donors in Ottawa — for them the questions were never hypothetical.

I don't have a tidy conclusion here. I'm still working through it. The fact that three parallel payment systems exist, each optimized for different values, tells me that the values themselves are genuinely in tension. Convenience, privacy, and control aren't fully compatible. Every payment method is a bet on which one matters most.

I picked cash for the coffee. I'm still not sure what that says about me.
