# Blog › Summaries

One file per published post: summary + full markdown copy for review. Generated by `npm run blog:from-posts`.

- **Location in repo:** `notes/blog/summaries/<slug>.md`
- **Contents:** Title, metadata (slug, published, tag, image), short summary, then full post body.

Use these to review or edit copy before syncing back (copy into `drafts/<slug>.md` and run `npm run blog:to-posts`).
