# Blog

Project for [[blog]] workflow: review published posts, draft new ones, and sync to the site (varunbaker.com).

**Repo:** [github.com/xandgate/blog](https://github.com/xandgate/blog)

## Purpose

- **Review** — Summaries and full copies of all published posts live under [[Blog/Summaries]] (generated by `npm run blog:from-posts`).
- **Draft** — New posts and edits go under [[Blog/Drafts]]. Sync to the site with `npm run blog:to-posts`.
- **Index** — [[Blog/Index]] lists every post with slug, date, and tag for quick reference.

## Quick links

- [[Blog/Index]]
- [[Blog/Drafts]]
- [[Blog/Summaries]]
- [[BLOG_PUBLISHING]] (workflow doc in repo root)

## Sync commands (run in repo)

```bash
# Export current posts → notes/blog/summaries/ and index
npm run blog:from-posts

# Sync notes/blog/drafts/*.md → src/app/blog/posts/*.mdx
npm run blog:to-posts
```
