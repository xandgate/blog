# Copy-paste content for Logseq Blog project

Create these 4 pages in your Logseq graph (DevelopDigitally_RAG). Paste the content below into each page.

## Page: **Blog**

Create a page named exactly `Blog` and paste:

```
Project for blog workflow: review published posts, draft new ones, and sync to the site (varunbaker.com).
Repo: https://github.com/xandgate/blog

## Purpose

- **Review** — Summaries and full copies of all published posts live under [[Blog/Summaries]] (generated by `npm run blog:from-posts`).
- **Draft** — New posts and edits go under [[Blog/Drafts]]. Sync to the site with `npm run blog:to-posts`.
- **Index** — [[Blog/Index]] lists every post with slug, date, and tag for quick reference.

## Quick links

- [[Blog/Index]]
- [[Blog/Drafts]]
- [[Blog/Summaries]]

## Sync commands (run in repo)

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Export current posts → notes/blog/summaries/ and index
npm run blog:from-posts

# Sync notes/blog/drafts/*.md → src/app/blog/posts/*.mdx
npm run blog:to-posts
#+END_SRC
```

## Page: **Blog/Index**

Create a page named exactly `Blog/Index` (or a child page "Index" under "Blog") and paste:

```
Master list of all blog posts. Regenerated by `npm run blog:from-posts`.

Use for: quick lookup of slug, date, tag before editing or publishing.

## Page: **Blog/Drafts**

Create a page named exactly `Blog/Drafts` and paste:

```
Markdown drafts that sync to the site via `npm run blog:to-posts`.

- **Location in repo:** notes/blog/drafts/*.md
- **Output:** src/app/blog/posts/<slug>.mdx
- **Frontmatter (optional):** title, subtitle, summary, publishedAt, tag, image. Slug = filename without .md

Add a new file in the repo (e.g. notes/blog/drafts/my-next-post.md) with optional YAML frontmatter and body, then run in the repo:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm run blog:to-posts
#+END_SRC

Link from: [[Blog]].
```

## Page: **Blog/Summaries**

Create a page named exactly `Blog/Summaries` and paste:

```
One file per published post: summary + full markdown copy for review. Generated by `npm run blog:from-posts`.

- **Location in repo:** notes/blog/summaries/<slug>.md
- **Contents:** Title, metadata (slug, published, tag, image), short summary, then full post body.

Use these to review or edit copy before syncing back (copy into drafts/<slug>.md and run `npm run blog:to-posts`).

Link from: [[Blog]], [[Blog/Index]].
```

## How to create in Logseq

1. Open Logseq with graph **DevelopDigitally_RAG**.
2. Create page **Blog**: click "+" or use command palette → "Create new page", name it `Blog`, paste the first block above.
3. Create **Blog/Index**: create a new page named `Blog/Index` (or create page "Index" and make it a child of "Blog" depending on your graph). Paste the Index content.
4. Same for **Blog/Drafts** and **Blog/Summaries**.
5. Link them: the [[Wiki links]] in the content will resolve once the pages exist.

If your Logseq uses file-based storage, the page "Blog/Index" might create a path like `pages/Blog/Index.md`; adjust names if your graph uses a different hierarchy.
